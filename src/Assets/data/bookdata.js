        authorbio: `
        Emma Stone never planned on writing horror, until a sleepless night and a creaky floorboard convinced her otherwise. Born and raised in a small town where stories travelled faster than cars, she grew up surrounded by whispers, shadows, and the kind of silence that makes you check twice before turning off the lights.
        
        Sanctum is her debut novel, inspired by a real house she once lived in (and swore she’d never step foot in again). Emma writes with a love for the eerie, the emotional, and the kind of fear that lingers long after the last page. When she’s not writing, she’s probably binge-watching ghost documentaries, drinking too much coffee, or trying to convince herself that the noise in the attic is “just the wind.”

        A place once meant for peace. Now it just wants to keep you.
        
        When Emma and her brother move into the old house on Grayson Hill, they think they’ve scored big, cheap rent, quiet neighbors, and a fresh start. But the house has its own plans. Doors don’t stay shut. Whispers crawl through the vents. And something in the basement is waiting.
        
        Locals call it the Sanctum. They say it used to be a church, then a home, then... something else. Nobody really knows. But everyone agrees on one thing: people go in, and they don’t come out the same.
        
        Emma starts seeing things. Her brother sleepwalks into rooms they never unlocked. And the house? It’s learning. It’s watching. It’s hungry.
        
        Sanctum isn’t just haunted. It’s alive.

        Peace in Abandonment follows Maasha, a young Iranian woman who becomes an undocumented immigrant in the UK after fleeing the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s. But Masha doesn’t escape alone. With her, a handful of specially abled strangers and kids as fellow refugees, she barely knows, yet chooses to protect with unwavering resolve.
        
        Set against a backdrop of war, exile, and emotional ruin, the novel explores the brutal weight of displacement, discrimination, mental health, and the quiet desperation of survival. As Masha struggles to protect those in her care, she is forced into a devastating choice laced with pain, courage, and the blurred lines between dignity and survival.
        
        Peace in Abandonment doesn't offer easy answers, only the quiet, aching question of what it means to stay human when everything else is lost and what Maasha will get in return?.
        
        A story of fractured identities and impossible decisions, Peace in Abandonment asks: How far can one go to remain human when the world refuses to see you as one?

        Someday Perhaps is a short work of fiction that explores themes of parenting, mental health, and social discrimination. The narrative follows two central characters, a young girl and an elderly man, whose perspectives offer a contrast between innocence and experience.
        
        Set against the backdrop of modern society, this tale explores how small acts of empathy and understanding can ripple outward to create lasting change
        
        The book is based on real-life observations and personal encounters with the issues it addresses. It does not aim to provide solutions, but rather to present situations that may prompt reflection. The tone is straightforward, and the storytelling is intentionally simple.
        
        This book may have some answers, but it mainly focuses on questions that the kind people ask quietly, often late at night, and rarely aloud.
