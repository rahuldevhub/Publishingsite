        poem: `I left behind all my belongings,
            Just to reach you with pure love.
            Sorry, babe, I lied---
            It’s just the shovel, a piece to reach my love.

            The sun dips below the horizon,
            No one can see us kiss.
            Sorry, babe,
            For spoiling your lip gloss, I’ll buy a new one for you my love.
            
            I can smell your hair,
            Through the thin air.
            Sorry, babe, for the odour—
            It’s just the sweat; we’ll forget it out of love.
            
            My eyes turned red,
            Since the day you left.
            Sorry, babe, for skipping the meds—
            I’ll rest in your arms now, scratch my head, like you always do, my love.
            
            I’m not crying,
            It’s just the showers.
            Sorry, babe, I lied—
            It’s my tears, and I don’t want to drench you in them, my love.
            
            Do you remember the frogs and bees,
            Back in our garden?
            They sang for you all night, since you left---
            And it was me in the daytime, for you my love.
            
            Fuckin napkins were gone,
            Really gone.
            Sorry, babe, I used your skirt—
            Just to save your picture from the tears of your love.
            
            My show will take place in a while, 
            My agony will be gone in a while. 
            Sorry, babe, 
            I can’t pull the crowd; it’s just you and me, my love. 

            Is it worth it without you, my love?
            I questioned my existence. 
            Sorry, babe, 
            The answer I was looking for—it was you, my love. 

            This drug isn't working, 
            I don’t know why. 
            All I feel is getting closer to you—
            With all my heart, my love. 

            Divine and grace is what I feel, 
            By getting closer every inch, 
            I’m the happiest man in the world, 
            I see you sprinting towards me, 
            I’m gonna drop this California poppies, 
            Pen, paper, and my breathe altogether, On your feet-- 
            As always I loved to stay, 
            Hug me tight, 
            As closer you can, as tighter you can, 
            My hands tremble, I don’t feel my body, 
            Where were you my love, 
            I was worried, 
            Hold my hands, and never___`

            Father and daughter, hand in hand,
            Across the border of their homeland,

            No worries weigh their hearts,

            A melody of love and trust,
            As they navigate the open sea,
            Bound by an unspoken bond.

            The sun rises, painting the sky,
            With hues of gold and amber light,
            Pushing them towards a new horizon,
            Where peace and tranquility reside.

            In this moment, we are infinite,
            Me and my dad, side by side,
            Sailing through the border of our homeland,
            With hearts unburdened, and spirits light.`

        Standing quietly in the corner
        Just waiting for you to reach their hand to help you!
        There always is someone

        Of hope that springs from autumn's blaze.
        
        A farmer's hands, so rough and worn,
        Cradle dreams within their grasp,
        Through drought and storm, they’re not yet torn,
        With faith that future seeds will clasp.

        The earth remembers every tear,
        Each seed sown in defiance bold,
        In barren times, there's still no fear,
        For life within the soil takes hold.
        
        So let the dead crops tell their tale,
        Of battles fought and lessons learned,

        As swings and slides his joy embrace,
        Yet in the father’s heart a fight,
        For future trials his son may face. 

        These moments, sweet and undisturbed,
        Hold whispers of the years to come,
        A father’s love, so deeply stirred,
        By thoughts of what his child becomes.
        
        Will he be strong, in chaos bold?
        Will kindness guide him through the fray?
        These questions in the father’s hold,
        As shadows cast on bright today. 

        But for now, he treasures each smile,
        Each giggle in the sunlit park,
        Hoping to shield, though just a while,
        His son from world’s impending dark.

        poem: `
        In the dim-lit attic,
        Shadows wove his days,
        A brush, a palette,
        In solitary gaze.  
        
        His wallet empty, dreams filled his heart,
        For a canvas and colors, he played his part.
        With torn clothes, and eyes lit with fire,
        He painted his passion, his one desire. 

        The world outside, cold and unforgiving,
        Yet in art’s embrace, he found his living.
        One day she came, like a whisper soft,
        To pose for a picture, in light aloft.
        
        Her beauty simple, pure and bright,
        She became his muse, his guiding light.
        Her laughter echoed, in his heart confined,
        Her presence an anchor, to a soul entwined. 

        He painted her essence, her spirit, her grace,
        In every stroke, her visage he traced.
        Though pockets were bare, his love was whole,
        For art and her, he bared his soul.

        They lived through poverty, strife, and pain,
        Yet together they stood, in sunshine and rain.
        For money fades, and riches depart,
        But art and love, reside in the heart. 

        In the world of canvas, dreams unfurled,
        A poor artist, and his muse, against the world.

        content: `
        <p>At dawn, the air in my grandmother’s house would carry the scent of boiling milk. It was the kind of smell that felt ancient and eternal, as if it had been wafting through the corridors of Indian homes for centuries. The milk wasn’t just a drink; it was a ritual. It frothed and hissed in a battered steel pot, threatening to spill over, as she stood by the stove, her movements precise, almost reverential. </p>
       
        <p>In India, milk is never boiled absentmindedly. There’s always a watchful eye, a wooden ladle at the ready to tame its rebellion. My grandmother believed milk had a personality—a stubbornness that required respect. "If you don’t watch it," she would say, "it will punish you." And indeed, when left unwatched, it would rise in a silent fury, spilling over the pot’s edges, marking its territory on the stove, a rebellion against negligence.</p>
       
       <p>Life in India, I realized, is a lot like that boiling milk—volatile, vibrant, always on the verge of spilling over. There’s no autopilot here. You watch, you intervene, you adapt. This was the mindset I grew up with: everything demands your attention because everything matters.</p>
       
       <p>In the Indian mindset, nothing is just what it seems. A cup of chai is not just tea; it’s an offering to the gods of conversation. A simple lentil curry is a repository of ancient wisdom, its flavors layered with history and intention. Even the act of stepping out of the house is preceded by a ritual—a murmured prayer, a touch of turmeric on the doorframe for luck, a glance at the calendar to ensure the day is auspicious.</p>
       
       <p>Growing up, I often resented this obsession with the sacred. Why couldn’t we just live without dissecting every moment for its significance? But as I got older, I began to understand. These rituals weren’t burdens; they were anchors. In a country as chaotic as ours, where the honking of autorickshaws competes with temple bells, and life often teeters on the edge of unpredictability, rituals are how we find order in the chaos. They remind us to pause, to watch, to be present—like the boiling milk.</p>

       <p>Being Indian is also to live with the weight of expectations. They come at you from all directions: from family, from society, from ancestors whose portraits hang in the corners of living rooms, staring down at you with the quiet authority of people who survived famines and colonial rule.</p>

       <p>“You have to study hard,” my mother would say, “not for yourself, but for the family. Your success is our success.” The idea of individualism felt almost foreign in our household. Decisions were collective, made over long dinners where everyone had an opinion. Careers, marriages, even the timing of a haircut—nothing was exempt from scrutiny.</p>

       <p>At times, it felt suffocating. But there was also a strange comfort in it. You were never truly alone in your choices. When I struggled, there were always a dozen hands ready to catch me, a dozen voices reminding me that I belonged to something larger than myself.</p>
       
        <p>India is a land of contradictions, and so are its people. We thrive on paradoxes. We worship Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and yet we bargain fiercely with street vendors over a few rupees. We perform elaborate rituals to invoke rain, yet we curse the monsoon when it floods our streets. We are proud of our traditions but impatient with their restrictions.</p>

       <p>This duality is reflected in the mindset we carry—a blend of patience and urgency, reverence and rebellion. It’s why we can sit through a three-hour Bollywood film without complaint, yet erupt into a frenzy if someone cuts the queue at the ATM. It’s why we can adapt to any corner of the world but still crave the exact texture of our mother’s homemade chapati.</p>
       
       <p>Years later, standing in my own kitchen, I watched a pot of milk rise and foam. I remembered my grandmother’s words, her steady hand as she stirred, her belief that even milk deserved attention. And suddenly, it made sense.</p>

        <p>To be Indian is to watch life closely, to understand that nothing is too small to matter. Whether it’s the first cry of a peacock announcing the rains or the precise shade of marigold used in a wedding garland, we are a people who notice. We are a people who care. And like the boiling milk, our lives are messy and unpredictable, spilling over the edges in ways we can’t always control. But if you stand close enough, if you watch carefully, there is beauty in the chaos, warmth in the ritual, and meaning in the mundane.</p>

        <p>AMargaret had spent her entire life waiting—for children to grow up, for her husband to retire, for the perfect moment to chase the dreams she had always put on hold. Now, at seventy-eight, she had nothing left to wait for. Her husband had passed, her children were scattered across the world, and her home felt emptier than ever. So, she packed her bags, sold the house, and embarked on a journey she had long promised herself. A world trip—a farewell tour of sorts.</p>
        
        <p>AShe was in Istanbul when she found him.
    
        <p>AA scruffy Persian cat, his once luxurious coat now matted and dirty, sat in the shadows of the Grand Bazaar. He was old, his movements slow, his eyes tired but wise. Something in his gaze mirrored Margaret’s own reflection—a life lived long, filled with stories, and an aching loneliness that had settled deep within their bones.</p>

        <p>AShe bent down, extending a frail hand, and the cat sniffed it warily before pressing his head into her palm. That was all it took. Margaret scooped him up, feeling the frailty of his body against hers.</p>

        <p>A“Well,” she murmured, stroking his ear, “looks like we’re both wanderers now.” </p>

        <p>AShe named him Rumi, after the poet who spoke of love and longing</p>

        <p>AThe airline didn’t make it easy, but Margaret was persistent. With some help from a local vet, she got Rumi the necessary clearances, and together, they continued her journey</p>

        <p>AFrom the canals of Venice to the cherry blossom-lined streets of Kyoto, they wandered. Margaret would sip her morning tea with Rumi curled up on her lap, his purring a soft reminder that she was not alone. At night, when the weight of the years pressed heavy on her chest, he nestled close, offering warmth and silent understanding.</p>

        <p>AIn Paris, they sat beneath the Eiffel Tower as dusk painted the sky in hues of gold and lilac. Margaret fed Rumi bits of croissant, watching as he nibbled them delicately, his cloudy eyes flickering with pleasure.</p>

        “<p>AI wonder,” she mused aloud, “if you had a home before. A family. Someone who loved you.”</p>

        <p>ARumi blinked slowly, his tail flicking once.</p>

        <p>AMargaret sighed. “I had a home too. A family. But I suppose love is not just about who we begin with, but who we find along the way.”</p>

        <p>AThey traveled through the bustling streets of New York, the sacred temples of India, the quiet countryside of Scotland. With each passing month, Rumi grew weaker. Margaret could see it—the way his legs trembled when he walked, the way he slept more than he used to. She knew time was slipping through their fingers, just as it was for her.</p>
 
        <p>AOne evening in Santorini, as they watched the sun sink into the Aegean, Rumi rested his head on her lap, his purrs fainter than before. Margaret ran her fingers through his fur, whispering soft words of comfort.</p>

        <p>A“Have I made you happy, my friend?” she asked.</p>

        <p>AHis only response was a slow, tired blink. But she knew. She knew because he had made her happy too.</p>

        <p>ARumi passed away a few weeks later in the small village of Hallstatt, Austria. Margaret buried him beneath an ancient oak, near the edge of the lake where they had spent their last days together. She sat by his grave for hours, letting the grief wash over her, knowing she had lost more than just a companion. She had lost a part of her soul.</p>

        <p>AShe continued her journey, but it was never quite the same. The empty space in her lap, the absence of his soft weight beside her at night—it was a quiet ache that never faded.</p>

        <p>AMonths later, Margaret found herself in a small bookstore in Prague. As she flipped through a collection of poetry, a verse caught her eye:</p>

        <p>ABe like a river, my love, forever moving, never lost.</p>

        <p>AShe smiled, a single tear slipping down her cheek. Rumi had been her river, guiding her through the last great adventure of her life.</p>

        <p>AWhen Margaret passed away a year later, she was buried in Hallstatt, beneath the same oak where Rumi rested. Two wanderers, two old souls, finally home together.</p>

        <p>AAnd somewhere, in the quiet hum of the wind through the leaves, the echo of a purr still lingered.</p>

       <p>From the moment she was born, Hannah saw the world differently. Her mother called it a gift, her father a curse. It was not until her tenth birthday, when she received the magnifying glass from her grandmother, that she truly understood her unique perspective.</p>

        <p>The magnifier was no ordinary tool; it had a wooden handle carved with intricate patterns and a lens so clear, it felt like gazing through crystal-clear water. When she peered through it, the world seemed to transform, amplifying the beauty in even the most mundane objects. A drop of dew on a blade of grass became a shimmering diamond, a simple leaf revealed a universe of veins and textures, and the wings of a butterfly displayed an infinite palette of colors.</p>

        <p>Hannah grew up in the small, picturesque town of Everwood, a place where everyone knew each other and where the pace of life was as gentle as the breeze rustling through the ancient oak trees. The town itself was a canvas of wonders waiting to be discovered. Each day after school, Hannah would venture out with her magnifying glass, exploring the nooks and crannies of Everwood, uncovering its hidden treasures.</p>

        <p>One sunny afternoon, she found herself in the town's central park, an oasis of greenery and tranquility. She sat on a wooden bench beneath a sprawling willow tree, holding her magnifier up to a dandelion. As she gazed through the lens, the delicate seeds became tiny parachutes, ready to carry dreams to faraway lands. It was in these moments that Hannah felt a profound connection to the world around her.</p>

        <p>People often marveled at her ability to see beauty where others saw none. Her best friend, Emily, would sometimes accompany her on these explorations, though she could never fully grasp what Hannah saw. "How do you do it?" Emily would ask, squinting at a pebble that Hannah found enchanting.</p>

        <p>"It's all about perspective," Hannah would reply with a smile. "You just have to look a little closer, and you'll see the magic hidden in everything."</p>

        <p>As she grew older, Hannah's gift became more than just a hobby. She began to capture the world's beauty through her art. Her paintings and sketches, each an intricate masterpiece, earned her recognition far beyond the borders of Everwood. Yet, despite the accolades, she remained humble, always returning to her roots, her magnifier never far from her side.</p>

        <p>One crisp autumn morning, as Hannah walked through the park, she noticed a young boy sitting alone on the bench beneath the willow tree. His face was etched with sadness, his shoulders slumped in defeat. Intrigued, she approached him, her magnifier dangling from its chain around her neck.</p>

        <p>"Hello," she said softly, not wanting to startle him. "Are you alright?"</p>

        <p>The boy looked up, his eyes filled with a mixture of surprise and curiosity. "I'm fine," he muttered, though his tone betrayed him.</p>
 
        <p>Hannah sat beside him, offering a warm smile. "You know, sometimes when I'm feeling down, I like to look at the world through this." She held up her magnifier. "It helps me see things differently, makes me realize how much beauty there is around us."</p>

        <p>The boy's eyes widened as he took the magnifier from her hand. Hesitantly, he held it up to a nearby flower, and his expression transformed. The petals, delicate and vibrant, seemed to come alive before his eyes.</p>

        <p>"It's amazing," he whispered, a hint of wonder in his voice.</p>

        <p>"Yes, it is," Hannah agreed. "Sometimes, all it takes is a different perspective to change how we feel."</p>

        <p>Over time, Hannah's gift had a ripple effect on the people of Everwood. Her art and her unique way of seeing the world inspired others to look beyond the surface, to find joy in the simplest of things. She taught workshops at the local community center, sharing her techniques and encouraging others to use magnifiers of their own.</p>

        <p>Through her lens, the mundane became magical, the ordinary extraordinary. She showed the world that there was always something beautiful to be found, no matter how bleak things seemed. Her magnifier became a symbol of hope, a reminder that perspective could change everything.</p>

        <p>Years passed, and Hannah's hair turned silver, her steps a bit slower. Yet her spirit remained as vibrant as ever. She continued to explore, to create, and to inspire. Even in her twilight years, she marveled at the world through her magnifier, her heart always filled with wonder.</p>

        <p>In the end, Hannah's legacy was not just her art, but the way she had touched the hearts of those around her. She had taught them to see the world differently, to appreciate the beauty in every moment. And as the sun set on her final day, she held her magnifier up to the sky, the colors of the sunset blending into a masterpiece of her own making.</p>

        <p>For Hannah, and for those who had learned from her, the world would always be a place of endless wonder, seen through the lens of a heart full of love and a magnifier that revealed the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

        content: `<p>Literature has always been a cornerstone of human culture, offering a windowintothedepths of human experience and the complexities of society. Its significance extends far beyond mere entertainment, playing a crucial role in shaping minds, fosteringempathy, preserving cultural heritage, and stimulating critical thinking. </p>
            
             <h2>Fostering Empathy and Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <p>One of the most profound impacts of literature is its ability to foster empathy. Bydelving into the lives, emotions, and experiences of characters, readers step out of their own realities and into those of others. This journey broadens emotional depthand understanding, allowing readers to connect with diverse perspectives andexperiences1. For instance, Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird” teaches readers about racial injustice and compassion, extending the boundaries of our empathy.  </p>
            

             <h2>Preserving Cultural Heritage</h2>
            <p>Literature serves as a repository of cultural heritage, preserving the stories, traditions, and values of different societies. Through literature, we gain insights intothehistorical contexts and cultural landscapes that have shaped human civilization. Works like Homer’s “The Iliad” offer invaluable glimpses into the past, helpingus understand the evolution of human thought and society.  </p>
            

             <h2>Stimulating Critical Thinking and Analytical Skills</h2>
            <p>Engaging with literature requires readers to analyze, interpret, and critique complexnarratives and themes. This process hones critical thinking and analytical skills, encouraging readers to question established norms and consider alternativeperspectives. Literature challenges us to think deeply about moral dilemmas, societal issues, and the human condition, fostering a more reflective and informed worldview.  </p>
            

             <h2>Personal Growth and Development</h2>
            <p>Literature is also a powerful tool for personal growth. By navigating the challenges and triumphs of fictional characters, readers often find parallels in their own lives, gaining insights and inspiration. This reflective process can lead to greater self- awareness and emotional maturity. Characters’ journeys can mirror our own, offeringguidance and solace during times of uncertainty. </p>
            
            
            <h2>Societal Impact and Change</h2>
            <p>Beyond individual growth, literature has the power to influence societal change. Bypresenting alternative viewpoints and challenging the status quo, literature can inspiremovements and shifts in societal attitudes. Works like George Orwell’s “1984”or Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart” have sparked critical conversations about governance, colonialism, and identity, demonstrating literature’s role as a catalyst for social progress. </p>
            

             <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In an ever-evolving world, the importance of literature remains steadfast. It nurtures our capacity for empathy, enriches our understanding of cultural heritage, sharpens our critical thinking, and supports personal and societal growth. Embracing literatureallows us to navigate the complexities of contemporary life with wisdom, empathy, and an enduring connection to our collective humanity. </p>

        <p>You know what deserves a standing ovation? Not me finishing my to-do list (because LOL when does that happen), but my laptop surviving another crash despite sounding like a tractor since 2020.bNo one talks about these things. No one says, “Hey, thank you, socks, for not sliding down in my shoes today.” But those socks? They carried your emotional baggage all day without complaint.</p>
 <p>Let’s take a moment to appreciate the little things that never get appreciation.</p>
 <p>Like the exact moment you open your front door, and the Wi-Fi automatically connects. That’s intimacy. That’s loyalty. That’s better than most relationships these days. Or when your friend texts, “I’m outside,” just when you were wondering how to exit that awkward family dinner. That’s not just friendship—that’s divine timing. That’s the universe sending backup.</p>
 <p>And what about that one hoodie that understands your soul? The one you’ve worn for so many years it has its own scent and trauma history? It’s seen your heartbreaks, your post-shower dance moves, and your existential 2 a.m. snack hunts. But do we thank it? No. We just throw it on again like it didn’t carry us through five mental breakdowns.</p>
 <p>Okay, let’s be real for a sec. When was the last time you said thank you to your phone charger for not abandoning you at 2%? Or to that one good pen that always works, even though you’ve chewed off half the cap?</p>
 <p>Exactly. Never. Because we, dear human beings, are tragically bad at appreciating the little things.</p>
 <p>We wait for “big moments” to feel grateful—like when we get the job, pass the exam, or someone gives us cake. But life isn’t just a highlight reel. It’s mostly the in-between scenes—you know, like finding a seat on a bus that doesn’t squeak or making it through a conversation without sounding weird (barely).</p>

 <p> <p>Case in point: Last week, I stepped in dog poop while wearing my favourite sneakers. Tragic. But then—plot twist—I found tissues in my pocket. And not the sad, crumpled kind. Fresh. Clean. Ready to save lives. I looked up at the sky like, “Thank you, mysterious past me, for being responsible for once.”</p>

 <p> <p>That’s the stuff we forget to be grateful for. The tiny wins. The background blessings. The universe’s low-key “I gotchu” moments.</p>
 <p> <p>A quick shoutout to:</p>

 <p> <p>The auto uncle who doesn’t judge when you’re clearly late and dying.</p>

 <p> <p>Google Maps for not letting you walk into the ocean.</p>

 <p> <p>That one spoon in the drawer that’s just the right shape and you choose it every single time.</p>

 <p> <p>And honestly… your own body. Like hey, thanks for showing up today even though I’ve been surviving on caffeine, vibes, and sheer willpower.</p>

 <p>We’re all busy chasing the big stuff—the dream job, the perfect relationship, the glow-up. But it’s the micro-wins that actually make life liveable. You don’t realize it, but that one playlist you made in 2019? Still carrying your emotions like a soldier. </p>
 <p>Honestly, we’ve glamorized drama and burnout so much, we forgot that life is also about cold water on a hot day, stretchable jeans, and group chats where someone finally replies with “same” when you’re ranting.</p>
 <p>So maybe today, take a second. Pause your scroll. Look around. Is your Wi-Fi working? Is your snack crunchy? Did a pigeon not poop on you today? Iconic.</p>
 <p>Say thank you. Whisper it. Think it. Meme it. Doesn’t matter. Gratitude is chill like that. It doesn’t need a party—just a nod of recognition.</p>
 <p>Because the small stuff? That’s the real magic. And honestly, it’s been patiently waiting for you to notice.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, gratitude isn’t loud. It’s just you, smiling alone in a crowded train because the aunty next to you just offered a mint. Or when your pet cuddles up to you like they know you’ve had a crappy day. And hey—if you’re reading this, maybe you needed the reminder. No, you don’t have to fake some deep, spiritual moment. You just have to notice. To feel the small things. The unnoticed heroes of your everyday chaos. Because life isn’t one big “wow.” It’s a hundred tiny “phew”s that keep you from falling apart. So go on. Whisper a thank you to your favorite mug. Wink at your power bank. Hug that hoodie.</p>
 <p>Be extra. Be dramatic. Because even the tiniest joy deserves a little bit of confetti.</p>`

        poem: `
        "Love's gentle touch ignites souls,
        Like sunrise warmth on frosty goals.
        While fear's cold grip controls the night,
        Love's radiant beams dispel the darkest light.

        For love is strength, not weakness true,
        A bond that heals, and sees us through.
        Like a river's flow, it nurtures deep,
        And in its warmth, our hearts retreat.

        So let love lead, and fear subside,
        Like autumn leaves, let doubts divide.
        Embracing kindness, side by side,
        In love's lush garden, we reside.

//         Every Tuesday morning in the college library, Ayaan sat at the far end with his sketchbook. He wasn't there for books — he was there for her.

// Mira.

// She always took the same seat by the window, third row from the door. She’d plug in her headphones, sip her chai, and read—completely unaware of the boy sketching her from across the room.

// Ayaan wasn’t in love. Not yet. But he was fascinated.

// It wasn’t just her eyes. It was the way she blinked. Slow, like she was savoring every thought. Not rushed or mechanical — like most people. Her blinks had intention. They came with emotion — frustration when she was stuck, joy when she read something funny, or stillness when she was lost in thought.

// He captured each of them. Page after page.

// But Ayaan never spoke to her. Until one day, the rain didn’t stop.

// The library closed early. As he packed his things, he saw Mira standing at the entrance, watching the downpour. No umbrella. No jacket.

// He hesitated. Then walked over and held out his umbrella.

// “You blink like you’re thinking in cursive,” he said before he could stop himself.

// She turned, confused. “Sorry?”

// He almost walked away. But then, for the first time, she smiled. And blinked — slowly.

// “You watch me?” she asked, more curious than angry.

// Ayaan nodded, heart pounding. “I sketch. Mostly people. Mostly… you.”

// She didn’t reply. The rain fell heavier.

// Finally, she said, “I thought you were just a chai guy who liked drawing windows.”

// They walked side by side, under the shared umbrella. She asked to see his sketches. He showed her. Page after page of her.

// “I never knew someone could fall in love with the way I blink,” she whispered.

// He grinned. “Neither did I.”

// Three years later.

// It was a quiet wedding. Just close friends and family.

// Mira stood at the mandap, radiant in red.

// Ayaan watched her through the lens of his memory — every blink, every laugh, every sketch he’d ever drawn of her was there, right in front of him.

// When the priest said, “You may now look into each other’s eyes,”

// She did. And blinked.

// He smiled. “Still in cursive.”

// She whispered, “Still yours.”

        Oh, the breezy wind 
And the lovely sky.
Nope this isn't me, anyways
 
So, 
It feels like centuries ago, 
But it's only been a decade or so, 
You could ask me, 
"If you haven't lived a century how do you know how it feels?"
But hey, don't we all have this type of longing,
The yearning for something, 
Something like…Our childhood.

The childhood, where we were oblivious to 
Status and money and race and love and touch
yeah, touch
I ain't true about most part but yeah

I mentioned longing? Yes.
Yes, I’ve been longing
To not stress over that question
Everyone throws around like candy -
"What next, ma?"
Like I got the answers hidden behind my tired eyes.

Yes, I’ve been longing
To just go out and play
All evening
With my friends,
Then do it again the next day,
And the next.

Yes, I’ve been longing
To open that old secret box —
The one with birthday cards,
And random friendship bracelets,
And broken pens I swore I’d fix.

Yes, I’ve been badly longing
To feel happy about something I did.
To look at it and think,
"Damn, I did that."
Yes, I’ve been longing for my parents’
Damn petty appreciation.

I’m longing for those…
Little things.
The stuff I didn’t know I’d miss.
Longing for a time
When nothing was too deep,
When existing didn’t feel like a to-do list.
When dreams didn’t come with
Terms and conditions.
I’m still longing.
Not for something new.
